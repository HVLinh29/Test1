										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">By integrating the IoT core inside the engine, users can enjoy many unique benefits only when controlling the <a href="https://lumi.vn/en/">Smart Gate LUMI &#8211; DEA</a>.</p>
<h2>Not only opening/closing the gate with Smartphone, but users can also check the real status of the gate right on the Lumi Life app</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10085" src="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-3.jpg" alt="check the actual" width="1400" height="1400" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-3.jpg 1400w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-3-300x300.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-3-100x100.jpg 100w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-3-600x600.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-3-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-3-150x150.jpg 150w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-3-768x768.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-3-510x510.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<div>
<p>Users can check the real status of the gate right on the Lumi Life app.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Over time, the remote control of opening/closing the gate has become a basic feature thanks to Remote, or by Smartphone like Lumi is providing to users. The user’s demand for a device called “smart” becomes more and more demanding, demanding more from the supplier. The LUMI – DEA smart gate is set up with features based on understanding this user’s needs, bringing features that are useful in situations that seem unlikely, but not always. not occur.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Suppose, your family starts the day in a great hurry so that the children can be on time for school and the parents are on time for work. Accidentally, while rushing to leave the house, you… forgot to close the gate. If you forget about this mistake, it looks like you can still have a comfortable working day. However, if you’re not sure if you’ve closed the gate or not, this worry will haunt you all day long.</p>
</div>
<div>Currently, on the market, automatic gates almost only help homeowners to open/close in a simple way. But with the smart gate LUMI – DEA, you can completely open the phone to check if the gate is really closed, or still open whether you are at work, or are returning home, or traveling abroad. This is a unique feature unique to homeowners who install LUMI – DEA smart gates.</div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Control gate opener (remote/smartphone, switch) in app history</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Along with the need for control, easy control of the home has also become imperative for users. Therefore, Lumi&#8217;s control system also records the opening/closing times of the gate and allows homeowners to easily access it in the history of the Lumi Life app.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10087" src="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-6.jpg" alt="smart gate - in the app history" width="1400" height="1400" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-6.jpg 1400w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-6-300x300.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-6-100x100.jpg 100w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-6-600x600.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-6-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-6-150x150.jpg 150w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-6-768x768.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-6-510x510.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<div>
<p>Lumi’s control system records the opening/closing times of the gate and allows homeowners to easily access it in the history of the Lumi Life app.</p>
</div>
<div>In the history section of the app, homeowners can easily review the time and device used to open/close the gate. This not only gives them peace of mind that the control of the gate is always in the hands of the owner but also provides information support for the homeowner in many other cases.</div>
<h2>Ensure security even in the event of loss of gate opening and closing devices such as Remote</h2>
<div>Housing security is increasingly becoming a group of top concerns for families, especially houses with large construction areas. Therefore, security devices applying smart technology are also increasingly interested, especially with home gates &#8211; the device is considered the first barrier for those who want to enter illegally.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As for the house gate, even after getting rid of opening the gate with the key, instead of using the Remote, the worry of dropping the opening device is always present. As for the LUMI &#8211; DEA smart gate motor, that worry is eliminated, because customers can easily delete the lost remote with the smartphone app. As a result, home security is always guaranteed, homeowners do not need to worry about unauthorized intrusions when accidentally losing the remote control gate.</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10089" src="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-4.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="1400" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-4.jpg 1400w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-4-300x300.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-4-100x100.jpg 100w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-4-600x600.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-4-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-4-150x150.jpg 150w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-4-768x768.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/anh-4-510x510.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<div>
<p>Easily delete the lost Remote with the smartphone app.</p>
</div>
<div>In particular, when integrated into Lumi’s Smart Home ecosystem, homeowners can take advantage of the network of smart devices in the home to build effective anti-theft scenarios. For example, during the period from 00:00 to 5:00 am, if the gate is opened, the lights in the house will immediately turn on, the alarm will be loud, combined with the multi-zone audio playing the segment. warning “There is a thief!”. As a result, the owner of the house will be completely secure about his home.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="article-body__drop-character article-body__first-paragraph">When you think about making your home &#8220;smarter&#8221;, the first thought is usually towards the thermostat or your front door — things you have to drop everything to interact with. Lights are usually high on the connected home list because for most people, using lights has been a part of everyday life since birth. Light switches are usually available as soon as you enter a room, and most people look for the cheapest possible way to light their home without needing to constantly replace bulbs.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more to lighting your home than flipping a switch, though. Connecting your lights to your home, especially a home ready to use Amazon&#8217;s Alexa service, makes a huge difference. Here&#8217;s how you choose the right lights for you and Alexa!</p>
<h2>Not all connected lighting setups are created equal</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-6013 size-large" src="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/echo-hue2-1024x768.jpg" alt="smart lighting" width="1020" height="765" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/echo-hue2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/echo-hue2-600x450.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/echo-hue2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/echo-hue2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/echo-hue2-400x300.jpg 400w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/echo-hue2-510x383.jpg 510w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/echo-hue2.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /></p>

<p>Step one for connecting your lights to Alexa is looking at your current lighting and deciding what needs to change. This is going to be a little different for everyone, but there are a few general options available.</p>
<p><em>Make your bulbs smarter</em> — if you&#8217;re currently running whatever was cheapest at the hardware store and have never considered LED lighting at all, all of your bulbs will likely need to be replaced. This leaves you with a lot of options but will end up being fairly expensive no matter what route you go.</p>
<p><em>Make your light switches smarter</em> — If you already have nice LED lights in your house, you may not <em>need</em> to replace your bulbs at all. There are smart light switches that will connect to your existing wiring and talk to Alexa in a way that lets you control entire rooms without replacing a single bulb.</p>
<p><em>Make your outlets smarter</em> — If you have rooms in your house that don&#8217;t have wired lighting, and you already have lamps and bulbs you like, there are smarter power outlets that will talk to Alexa and allow you to control the lights in that room without replacing bulbs or light switches.</p>
<p>Do you know which upgrade you need to make? Let&#8217;s take a look at the best hardware for your situation!</p>
<h2>The best way to make your bulbs smarter</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re replacing all of the light bulbs in a particular room, you want lights that will quickly connect to Alexa just the way you want. You also want something that will make it easy to grow beyond a single room without a lot of extra effort. Here are the options available to you!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-6015 size-full" src="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/philips-hue-alexa-press.jpg" alt="smart lighting" width="950" height="633" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/philips-hue-alexa-press.jpg 950w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/philips-hue-alexa-press-600x400.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/philips-hue-alexa-press-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/philips-hue-alexa-press-768x512.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/philips-hue-alexa-press-510x340.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px" /></p>
<p>It has been working on connected lighting longer than just about anyone else, and its Hue brand has a wide selection of lighting options to choose from. This includes standard lightbulbs, downlights, accent lights, and modular LED strips that can be added to just about any environment.</p>
<p>Bulbs are available in a standard white light option, as well as a fully configurable color solution, and have more third-party support than any other lighting setup right now.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-6017 size-full" src="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tp-link-alexa.jpg" alt="smart lighting" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tp-link-alexa.jpg 1200w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tp-link-alexa-600x338.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tp-link-alexa-300x169.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tp-link-alexa-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tp-link-alexa-768x432.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tp-link-alexa-510x287.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Connected bulbs are expensive, even when compared to standard LEDs. While it&#8217;s nice to know these bulbs will basically function forever, it&#8217;s still a lot of money upfront to make your home lighting smarter. The TP-Link LED bulbs make this a little easier to swallow with a noticeably lower per-bulb cost.</p>
<p>There are fewer options available through it, but if all you want is a way to connect lights through Alexa, these bulbs are a great way to fill your house with smarter lights.</p>
<h2>The best way to make your light switches smarter</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re already really happy with the lighting in your house and just want the lights to respond to your voice through Alexa, it&#8217;s possible you only need to replace your light switches. Smart switches can replace your existing switches with physical on, off, and dimmer functions but also connect that wiring to your home so you can use apps or voice to control everything.</p>

<p>These switches make it easy to connect entire rooms to Alexa and are considerably less expensive than replacing all of the lights in your house. The replacement switch will work similarly to your existing switch and comes with a remote control so you can adjust the lighting without leaving the couch or shouting at Alexa.</p>
<p>This is the best option for people who have already put some thought into the temperature and brightness of the bulbs in their home and just want a little more control without walking over to the switch</p>
<h2>An alternative approach to <a href="https://lumi.vn/en/">smart lighting</a></h2>
<p>Installing connected light bulbs isn’t the only way to get smart lighting. I’d argue the better alternative is to install smart light switches, especially if most of your home’s lighting comes from ceiling cans, pendants, or lamps plugged into wall outlets controlled by switches. It’s a little more expensive in the short run, but it gives you much more freedom in the long run.</p>
<p>All of the bulbs described above cost much more than the typical dimmable LED because they all have radios built into them. And a large majority of those bulbs cannot be installed in fixtures that are controlled by dimmer switches. If you’re going to have to replace a dimmer switch to install a smart light bulb, it might be more cost-effective to replace it with a smart dimmer switch and put a dumb dimmable LED in the socket. That way, if you have a broader smart-home system, you can link the switch to your door or motion sensors, so that the light turns on automatically when you enter the house or a room. You can also connect most smart switches to Amazon’s Alexa, but you will need to install a hub for those that don’t connect directly to Wi-Fi.</p>

<h2 class="vc_custom_heading"><strong>10 Lighting design ideas</strong></h2>
<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p><b>1. Mix different lights:</b> Combining different types of lighting options, like table lamps, floor lamps, and pot lights can create perfectly balanced lighting for your living room. You can add accent lights into this mix to illuminate artworks of the space.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p><b>2. Ceiling accent:</b> If you have a colorful or gorgeous ceiling, use ceiling accent lights to highlight it. You can play with different colors of lights and find the best color that makes your ceiling appear more elegant.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element">

</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p><b>5. Use multiple lights for a spacious room:</b> If your room is big then having just one light hanging from the ceiling is not a good idea. In that case, you need to use several lights covering other areas of your room and achieve the perfect balance. You can use a grid to hang multiple fixtures.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p><b>6. Lighting design for small space:</b> If your room is small, you should use the theme of spreading lights around. You can use tall lamps with small shades. This can make the room appear bigger than it is. You could also use wall lights focusing on corners.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p><b>7. Two in one:</b> You can use both pot lights and a hanging fixture in the center of the seating area of your living room. This can enhance the elegance of the room.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><i>Along with the continuous development of technology, a modern house is not only shown in new television and air conditioners, but even the simplest devices such as curtains become outstandingly intelligent. On July 17, 2020, Lumi officially launched the Smart Curtain Engine Works With Lumi Life, which promises to breathe a new life into the current curtain market.</i></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<h1 style="font-weight: 800;"><b>1. Combination with 2 smart controls to improve user experience</b></h1>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The demand for curtains of modern homeowners is becoming more and more strict. Not only focusing on the aesthetics as before, the owner is also interested in the function of the curtain such as: sun protection, UV protection, fine dust filter &#8230; Moreover, there are intelligent features that control the large and heavy curtains. instead of traditional hand pulling.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4393" src="http://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem2-2.jpg" width="1280" height="504" alt="Control curtains by Smartphone" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem2-2.jpg 1280w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem2-2-600x236.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem2-2-300x118.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem2-2-1024x403.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem2-2-768x302.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem2-2-510x201.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We are no strangers to using a remote to control automatic curtains. With the Works With Lumi Life smart curtain motor, however, the conventional remote isn&#8217;t the only remote control vehicle any more. Instead, modern home owners can use their own smartphones to perform more functions than just closing / opening the curtains.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Touch your smartphone to open / close the curtains whether at home or at work</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Timer close / open the curtain by operating in the app Lumi Life</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Install a curtain integration with light sensor to adjust the curtain according to the brightness in the room
</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4396" src="http://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem3-2.jpg" width="1280" height="504" alt="Voice Control feature" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem3-2.jpg 1280w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem3-2-600x236.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem3-2-300x118.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem3-2-1024x403.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem3-2-768x302.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem3-2-510x201.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Voice Control is also another scoring feature introduced by Lumi in this new product. Voice control via the virtual assistant Apple Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa is one of the strengths of the Lumi Smart Home system. This feature is fully transferred into the new product Smart Curtain Engine. For example, when the mother is lulling the baby to sleep, just call up the virtual assistant to close the curtains to make the light in the room darker, helping the baby to sleep deeply and soundly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<h1 style="font-weight: 800;"><b>2. Stable connection and accurate display of curtain status on the app</b></h1>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Lumi Life curtain motor works stably with a maximum load weight of 50kg, traction force of 1.2N and uses Zigbee wireless connection to connect to the control device. With this connection protocol, any change of status of the curtain whether controlled by the Lumi Life app or the user pulls the curtain manually will be accurately updated to the status on the Lumi Life app.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Zigbee wave not only ensures the transmission speed is more stable than WIFI, consumes less energy, but also allows the user to control the motor even when the house accidentally loses the Internet connection. This is the feature that makes the Zigbee standard so popular and trusted instead of Wifi in connecting and controlling smart devices in the home.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With more than 8 years of experience in researching and applying Zigbee in smart home connection, and testing and comparing with Wifi-operated motors, Zigbee communication is still selected by Lumi to increase the experience. of users with smart curtain motor products.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b> </b></p>
<h1 style="font-weight: 800;"><b>3. Easy installation and lower costs</b></h1>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, when you want to use the motor to control the curtain, the homeowner will need to add a control switch on the wall. This will make installation difficult in case the base infrastructure is not ready, requiring handling. In addition, each switch will only be able to adjust one set of fixed curtains, which is really inconvenient for homes using multiple curtains. All these shortcomings are completely overcome in Lumi&#8217;s Smart Curtain Motor product.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4398" src="http://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem4-2.jpg" width="1280" height="504" alt="Động cơ rèm thông minh lắp đặt nhanh" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem4-2.jpg 1280w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem4-2-600x236.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem4-2-300x118.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem4-2-1024x403.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem4-2-768x302.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dongcorem4-2-510x201.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><br />
With the IOT core programmed and installed integrated in the motor itself, the control switch becomes completely unnecessary, helping homeowners save a portion of the capital costs required for smart switches.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, since handling of the recessed base is eliminated, the curtain motor becomes extremely easy to install. Even a girl can complete a smart curtain engine in just &#8230; 15 minutes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b> </b></p>
<h1 style="font-weight: 800;"><b>4. Ready to be integrated into the system of Lumi Smart Home</b></h1>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Smart curtain engine is a product aimed at optimizing Lumi&#8217;s available Smart Curtain solution, but with improvements that bring practical benefits and more &#8220;economy&#8221; for users.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">Smart Home is no longer a bizarre concept to global citizens.  We can easily spot an automated lighting system in a friend’s house, intelligent camera surveillance at public places or a watering system which is able to operate without being controlled in neighbor’s.  Nevertheless, as a consumer, you must have been once overwhelmed by the huge wave of information about appliances that a smart home should have. Let’s find out the answer in the article below. </span></p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 800;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://lumi.vn/en/Smart-Home-ct-1-40-concave-glass-smart-switch.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Smart touch switch</span></a></span></h2>

<span style="color: #000000;">Smart touch switches are as important to a smart home as neurons to the brain. They play the role of receiving and transmitting signals from the external environment to the home controller to quickly and efficiently process information suitable for each situation, which is the essence of a smart home. Smart touch switches available on the market can be controlled by smartphone or by voice. </span><br />

<span style="color: #000000;">The secret of every smart home lies in its home controller. It is connected to all devices in the house, helping monitor their operating modes. With this HC, homeowners can “bring their houses in their pockets” everywhere, turn on/off, open/close appliances at their request whether being at the workplace or going abroad.  </span><br />

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">Besides keeping track of internal and external space of the house, smart security system also allows users to set up timer and trigger the protection function of the house.  Along with saving the history of any movement, this system can be integrated with other devices to create an anti-theft comprehensive scenario. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">Smart locks are controlled remotely and able to identify different faces/voices.Homeowners can let their guests in or refuse to open the door in case of anything unusual.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>Being the leader in the domestic market, owning the most comprehensive smart home ecosystem, what is the reason why Lumi Smart Home still worries about its product &#8211; a switch &#8211; an indispensable part of modern life?</i></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">In the world, many companies have become excellent at building famous brand names for their seemingly normal, trivial products such as 3M glue, Gillette razor &#8230; In Vietnam, an electric switch which may be simple but it is believed that with the combination of a good idea and serious dedication in the production and research team, they will be a great recipe for an inspiring brand story.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>The continuous pressure to complete touch switches during a decade comes from the company itself</b></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">For the founders of Lumi Smart House, the first platform product is the touch switch. Unlike traditional switches, smart touch switches use capacitive touch and built-in zigbee wireless connection, helping homeowners control electrical appliances remotely and create context via voice.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">During 9 years of persistence in bringing smart homes into the lives of Vietnamese families, although Lumi has launched many different product lines to develop its ecosystem, Lumi has never ceased to find the answer to the question: How to make smart touch switches better and better, the product that puts Lumi&#8217;s name on the map?</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4371" src="http://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01_1200x8001.jpg" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01_1200x8001.jpg 1200w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01_1200x8001-600x400.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01_1200x8001-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01_1200x8001-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01_1200x8001-768x512.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/01_1200x8001-510x340.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">One of the reasons why customers choose Lumi smart switches is its beauty. Despite major competitors from Europe or China with various designs, Lumi smart switch has remained the most reliable brand in the heart of users for nearly a decade.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">But only beauty is not enough. &#8220;Quality&#8221; is another key factor in the success of Lumi smart switches for many years. The company never ceased to develop our products so that they can provide users the best experience for every touch. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>115 test versions, changing 33 processing partners to produce a complete version of touch switch 2020</b></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">“When users get used to the touch switch with glass screen, we are planning to introduce the new version. The idea of a concave glass screen touch switch was born when customers shared: “Installing Lumi switches is like putting an Iphone on the wall. Nice  luxurious-looking! ”. So why don&#8217;t we turn the switch circle button into the legendary home button of Iphone? ”</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">Behind the beauty and perfection is the rigor of the research and production team. Mr. Nguyen Duc Tai &#8211; CEO of Lumi Joint Stock Company shared:</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">“This is the first smart switch for concave glass screens in Vietnam, but for Lumi, it is the 116th version. During the research process, Lumi tried 115 versions with 33 outsourcing partners to achieve the most perfect product so that it can provide users the best experience from every touch. Even the blind can easily turn on / off by touching switch button”</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>The results come from carefulness in every detail</b></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>Concave glass screen with bullnose edge</i></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">The technology of processing the concave glass surface is an extremely difficult technique, requiring meticulousness, precision and the application of new technology to create a glass surface with smooth curves and exquisite elegance. In Vietnam, there is no processing company that can execute this technique.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4373" src="http://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/06-1.jpg" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/06-1.jpg 1280w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/06-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/06-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/06-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/06-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/06-1-510x340.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to providing aesthetic value, the concave touch button optimizes the sensitivity of the switch when the distance from the finger touch point to the touch plate has been minimized.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4375" src="http://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/05_1200x800-3.jpg" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/05_1200x800-3.jpg 1200w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/05_1200x800-3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/05_1200x800-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/05_1200x800-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/05_1200x800-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/05_1200x800-3-510x340.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><i>Anode borders </i></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">Processed by anode technology, the aluminum border is covered with a thin layer of oxidation that provides extremely high strength and the hardness is nearly similar to that of diamond. Anode technology also allows manufacturers to choose different colors. However, the color pattern depends on the processing time in the chemical solution, as only a small difference in second can lead to the difference in color. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4378" src="http://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/v02_1200x830-1.jpg" width="1200" height="830" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/v02_1200x830-1.jpg 1200w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/v02_1200x830-1-600x415.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/v02_1200x830-1-300x208.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/v02_1200x830-1-1024x708.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/v02_1200x830-1-768x531.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/v02_1200x830-1-510x353.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">The careful calculation of every second to bring the right color versions to suit consumers&#8217; tastes is one of the factors that guarantees the attraction of Lumi&#8217;s concave glass switches. Currently, Lumi introduces this product line with 2 colors of Gold and Champagne.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Constantly asserting the position of the leader</b></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">Not only being the pioneer in the research of smart switch in Vietnam, Lumi has made conquered some outstanding achievements:</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8211; In May 2019, Lumi was the first Vietnamese Smart Home company to officially get the &#8220;Work with Google Assistant&#8221; certification, allowing users to control home appliances by voice with the help of Google Assistant. .</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8211; In November 2019, Lumi continued to announce that it was the first Vietnamese smart home company to successfully integrate with the Apple ecosystem. Users can use the Home application in iPhone, Apple Watch, Siri virtual assistant &#8230; to control their home.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8211; Lumi Vietnam is also the first Vietnamese smart home brand to export to 8 countries in the world such as Australia, India, Israel, Brazil, Lebanon, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos &#8230;</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">Taking quality and research capacity as thê comparative advantages, Lumi affirms this is the most solid way to stand at the forefront. In March 2019, despite the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Vietnam&#8217;s first touch switch with concave glass screen was introduced to the market as a confirmation: Vietnamese businesses will stand still with self-reliance on research and production.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong style="font-weight: 800;">Smart lighting is an inevitable result of the development of society</strong></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">Since the advent of the light bulb by Thomas Edison, a new era of the lighting industry has opened up. People no longer have to worry about the night when the sun goes down. Along with mankind&#8217;s evolution, when lighting became a necessity in life, higher demands for lighting systems arose: How to control light bulbs with human will?</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">Is it true that,</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">Watching movies in theaters is more interesting than at home as the lighting effect is beautifully impressive?</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">It is really annoying if in the morning, your eyesight is suddenly &#8220;beaten up&#8221; by the harsh light when someone turns on the bedroom light.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">Would a dinner be less romantic if the whole room was covered with white light from ordinary tube light?</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">It can be seen that light is present in all our living activities. Lighting also plays a huge role in creating a unique atmosphere and promoting human emotions. This is the time when smart lighting plays its role as an effective assistant to help your life become more fully with its preeminent features. </span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong style="font-weight: 800;">What you can do with a smart lighting system</strong></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong style="font-weight: 800;">Turn on / off the light via Smartphone or voice</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the basic function of the intelligent lighting system. With just a smartphone in hand, you can check the on / off status of indoor lights and turn on / off with just one touch. To explain more clearly about this function, let&#8217;s take an example of the intelligent lighting solution provided by Lumi Smart Home.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">To make your home lighting system smart, that is, controlled by smartphone or voice, you will need to replace the normal light switches with Lumi smart switches. Then you download the LumiLife app to your phone and can use the smart function of the light system. The status of the indoor lights will be displayed on the app, and you can turn on / off as you like with the touch buttons, or even by voice.</span></p>

<span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong style="font-weight: 800;">Setting timer for lights on / off</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">Setting timer to turn on the light will save you time and solve the problem of forgetting to turn off the light after using it. Of course, once you go to bed, you can still check and monitor the status of the light system on the smartphone. However, if your family has certain habits at a fixed time during a day, the timer function is an ideal way to make your life more comfortable. For example, if your home is used to trading certain goods / services, you can set up lights in the sign that will automatically light from 18:00 &#8211; 23:00 and turn off at the remaining time.</span><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong style="font-weight: 800;">Set up living scenarios for each specific activity</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">This can be considered as the most attractive function when installing intelligent lighting systems in the home. As mentioned above, light plays an important role in creating the atmosphere specific to each activity. You will not be able to fully enjoy a romantic movie with your lover in a bright white light or sleep with warm yellow light right into your eyes.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="color: #000000;">Fortunately, we can solve this problem with our own Smartphone. You can set the light of different colors, even adjust the brightness to suit living activities, events, programs in the family.</span><br />

Sooner or later, instead of &#8220;I want to install lights&#8221;, shoppers will say &#8220;I want to install smart lighting systems&#8221;, especially when smart lighting is part of the Ecology ecosystem which is expected to have outstanding growth in the near future.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;">Smart homes are thriving rigorously in Vietnam and worldwide. So what are the advantages of this new trend that make people crazy about? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Today, when IoT technology is on the rise, smart homes are not too strange with householders in Vietnam. As a pioneer in the Smart Home field, solutions of Lumi smart home have been and are being developed constantly to meet the demands of customers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 800;"><span style="color: #000000;">Advantages of smart home</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 800;"><span style="color: #000000;">1. Comfort</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Smart Home is equipped with electronic devices capable of interacting with people. Reaching each switch position to turn on the light or finding the remote control to open the curtain is no more as devices can operate automatically on their owner&#8217;s requests. With the latest research, your voice can also play a role in commanding devices to function. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 800;"><span style="color: #000000;">2. Save more</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Smart home gadgets not only provide a better experience but they also save energy thanks to the timer feature when the host can turn on / off electrical appliances anywhere, which is helpful in reducing monthly electricity bills. Your air conditioner automatically adjusts the temperature based on the weather information, or automatically turns off when you leave the house. The heater operates on / off based on the preset timer. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 800;"><span style="color: #000000;">3. Safer</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Safety is indispensable in any house, let alone smart home. 24/7 security system will give you peace of mind even when you are not at home. Smart home devices will alert your phone immediately in case of unwanted intrusion. Moreover, the system automatically records images of the incident in case you activate security mode. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 800;"><span style="color: #000000;">4. Better control</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">You can completely control the house when you are outside. Whether which devices are on or off, the curtains are closed or opened; just one touch on the phone and you will know all the information. For example: When you&#8217;re on your way to work, you only need to clik on your phone to activate &#8220;away&#8221; mode, all devices will turn off and activate security mode. Conveniently, right?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 800;"><span style="color: #000000;">5. More level</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What is better than a house that surprises the guests who come to visit?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When guests step into the house, the curtains automatically open, the lights in the living room automatically turn up, and the radio plays favorite tunes. Moreover, the air conditioner automatically adjusts the temperature accordingly. It&#8217;s your level, the difference and the comfort that is specific to your home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong style="font-weight: 800;">Smart home appliances</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It seems that the smart home solution&#8217;s advantages will need a lot of complicated equipment to meet, but with Lumi the devices are designed to be streamlined, luxurious but still exude a polite and classy look.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="font-weight: 800;"><b>House trend in the future</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, not only do people care about the design of the outside of a house but they also take comfort and convenience of appliances inside into consideration. Thanks to the development of technology, household utilities have been increasingly improved. In addition to the architecturally traditional trend, smart homes have received a lot of spotlight.<br />
We are living in a world of technology, where everything is connected via the Internet so the smart home trend has and will become an indispensable daily part. A perfect home is not only beautiful and luxurious in design, but it also has to bring a sense of comfort and convenience to homeowners. It needs to be more like a friend who understands all the emotions and demands of the owner more than just a living space. In simple terms, a smart home is a house in which devices from lights, curtains, air conditioners, to sound systems, security &#8230; are able to connect and communicate with each other based on a set schedule. These devices can be controlled by the owner from anywhere, via an internet connection.<br />

<h2 style="font-weight: 800;"><b>Why is the trend of smart home evolving?</b></h2>
<p>When we use the touch switch, you just glide your finger on the switch surface or on the touch screen of tablets, you have the entire control of the house.In particular, the smart home solution will allow you to monitor and set up schedule for multiple devices in the house at the same time on a mobile phone or tablet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security issues are also very much concerned but with our solutions, all household appliances will join the alarm system as soon as an unauthorized intrusion is identified.You can &#8220;assign tasks&#8221; to each device in each specific case, and control every state of operation of the house via phone. Besides that, the smart home solution also helps to save energy, protect the environment and especially improve the quality of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 800;"><b>Simple and easy to use</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be seen that the smart home trend has been chosen by many families. However, the fact that in Vietnam, many customers are still afraid to choose smart home solutions for worrying about the complexity of these devices. Understanding this insight, technology companies study and propose smart home solutions to ensure a balance between the complexity of the devices in the technology and the simplicity of installation and operation. use. With the application of Zigbee wireless technology and the design suitable for existing wall mounts, your home becomes smarter and more comfortable in just one to two days without changing the structure and design of the house.
