<h2><b>The key to making Lumi Smarthome a top priority for real estate projects</b></h2>

<h3><strong>Comprehensive smarthome ecosystem with high-quality products; A team of experienced engineers mastering core technology</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lumi Vietnam&#8217;s Smart Home Ecosystem includes over 65 individual items that work together to create a modern and convenient living space.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, the seamlessness of the Lumi smart home system is due to the solution&#8217;s mastery of technology in every component, which contributes to the maximization of user data security.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to meticulousness in each technical detail, designing and selecting product materials is one of the most crucial steps in launching a Lumi product. Because not only the utility value, the living space that Lumi brings to customers is always directed to the aesthetic value, expressing the owner&#8217;s personality. Therefore, all Lumi products are guaranteed to be sharp and sophisticated, giving a luxurious look to the living space.</span></p>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thailand smart home market has strong growth potential</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LED Expo is an annual event that serves to unite professionals in the lighting sector for commercialization, networking, and the dissemination of cutting-edge trends and information. In 2022, the exhibition was held in Bangkok, Thailand, attracting hundreds of booths and thousands of visitors worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Thailand has proven to be a promising market for developing smart home and smart lighting compared to other nations in the region. By 2026, the smart home industry in Thailand is expected to generate over $300 million in sales, up from an estimated $ 149.3 million in 2022. By 2026, an estimated 4.6 million American houses will have installed smart home technology. These figures are marginally more than their Vietnamese counterparts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Thailand has the potential to transform its population of nearly 70 million into a digital citizen, a global citizen. To date, Thailand has become a prosperous middle-income nation, with a GDP growth rate that places it eighth in Asia and second in Southeast Asia. Smart home and smart lighting technologies have a bright future in Thailand because of the country&#8217;s dynamism and capacity to adapt to the preferences of the populace as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lumi Vietnam hopes to learn more about why smart home development in Thailand has more significant potential than in Vietnam through its participation in LED Expo, while also discovering a &#8220;stage&#8221; where Vietnamese products may shine with international peers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Lumi at LED Expo Thailand: A strategic step to conquer the international market</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially, Lumi is the only smart home unit from Vietnam participating in LED Expo 2022. Many attendees were interested in the state-of-the-art smart home and smart lighting solutions developed by a group of Vietnamese engineers, known for their attention to detail and sleek design.</span></p>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lumi&#8217;s workshop inspire optimism for the future of smart home, smart lighting</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The show is a gateway for Lumi to meet more possible partners in its quest to dominate the Thai smart home industry, and it also serves as a unique opportunity to affirm the quality of Vietnamese products. Lumi warmly welcomes the handshakes of all firms with the same focus on IoT technology and the successes of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 in Vietnam, with the aim of making Vietnamese products more well-known in Thailand.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Dam Dac Quang, Overseas Sales Manager &#8211; Lumi Vietnam, spoke at the event and outlined the company&#8217;s vision: &#8220;With a team of engineers constantly being nurtured, in the past 10 years we have created a Smart home ecosystem of world level quality, CE and Quacert certificates. Lumi&#8217;s market expansion plan&#8221; will be bolstered by the success of their completed projects in Thailand, such as the 1253-unit luxury apartment skyscraper Life Asoke Hype and the 30-unit townhouse development Pleno in Nonthaburi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lumi Vietnam&#8217;s entry into the Thai market bodes well for Vietnamese industry overall and for manufacturers of cutting-edge technologies like smartphones and tablets in particular. The rising popularity of Vietnamese exports suggests that this is a direction that will continue.</span></p>

<h3><b>1. Why is the smart device business in Thailand a golden opportunity?</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13316 size-large" src="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Thai-smarthome-market-has-strong-growth-potential-1024x515.jpg" alt="" width="1020" height="513" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Thai-smarthome-market-has-strong-growth-potential-1024x515.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Thai-smarthome-market-has-strong-growth-potential-600x302.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Thai-smarthome-market-has-strong-growth-potential-300x151.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Thai-smarthome-market-has-strong-growth-potential-768x387.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Thai-smarthome-market-has-strong-growth-potential.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Thai smarthome market has strong growth potential</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statista estimates that the Thai smarthome market in 2022 will have a total revenue of 149.3 million USD, and by 2026, this number will be more than 300 million USD. The average number of smarthome households is 4.6 million homes by 2026. Although the total market revenue is not the leading in Southeast Asia, the Thai smarthome market has the largest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the region.</span></p>
<h4><em><b>Smart lighting &#8211; an essential piece of smarthome: the potential to &#8220;shine&#8221;</b></em></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the smarthome ecosystem, smart lighting is an important system that plays a core role and creates a significant value of a comfortable life of 4.0 technology standard. Smart lighting is a lighting system connected to the internet, an application on a phone to change lighting factors such as light intensity, color temperature, on/off timer and in combination with other devices in the lighting system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a report from Research and Markets, the global smart lighting market is forecast to reach $10.76 billion by 2022 and $27.27 billion by 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of 20.4%. With a growth rate of 22.4% during 2020-2030, Asia is the fastest growing region in the world for the smart lighting industry. This incredible growth is due to low labor costs and the availability of raw materials.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-13314" src="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Thailand-is-the-top-developed-country-in-the-region-1024x512.jpg" alt="" width="1020" height="510" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Thailand-is-the-top-developed-country-in-the-region-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Thailand-is-the-top-developed-country-in-the-region-600x300.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Thailand-is-the-top-developed-country-in-the-region-300x150.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Thailand-is-the-top-developed-country-in-the-region-768x384.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Thailand-is-the-top-developed-country-in-the-region.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thailand is the top developed country in the region</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thailand possesses the advantages to turn a population of nearly 70 million people into digital citizens or global citizens. Currently, Thailand is a middle-income country with a high GDP growth rate, ranking 8th in Asia and 2nd in Southeast Asia in particular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the proportion of smartphone users in Thailand is slightly higher than that of Southeast Asia (about 79% of the population in 2022). With the increasing number of smartphones, users will also be more familiar with using applications on their phones connecting with surrounding devices, which is the basis for smarthome to penetrate the market more easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thailand with its dynamism and ability to keep up with the trends promises to be a prosperous destination for technology products such as smarthome or smart lighting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>2. Overcoming barriers, initially exploring the million-dollar market</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thailand is an open environment for anyone who wants to start or expand a new technology product business in Southeast Asia. However, businesses providing smarthome and smart lighting solutions may face many challenges when &#8220;entering&#8221; this market. Sourcing quality products and building a commercialization process are obvious difficulties.</span></p>

<h3><b>What is Spotlight? What are the lighting characteristics of the spotlight?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotlights (or spotlights) are lighting fixtures that emit concentrated beams of light, typically used to highlight an object or make a dramatic visual impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern spotlights come in various designs, each optimized for a certain amount of illumination, making them equally useful for practical and aesthetic purposes. They can be used in various residential and commercial settings, including but not limited to restaurants, luxury hotels, art galleries, and exhibition halls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the latest smart spotlight lines enable users to modify the beam&#8217;s angle, intensity, and temperature from their phones, democratizing the &#8220;transformation&#8221; of space illumination. Mini Spotlights are one of Lumi Vietnam&#8217;s newest product lines, and they already satisfy the needs of most current consumers with their high quality of light, sleek design, and convenient smartphone control.</span></p>

<h3><b>Spotlight and applications in each space</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotlight lights now have a wide range of applications, allowing lighting designers to be more creative. An excellent way to break up the monotony of a space is to use a combination of different types of lighting, such as a spotlight, downlights, panels, and LED ceiling lights. Spotlights enhance the aesthetic value of any building, whether it be a contemporary office building or a historic mansion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-12503" src="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Spotlight2-768x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="463" height="617" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Spotlight2-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Spotlight2-scaled-600x800.jpeg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Spotlight2-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Spotlight2-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Spotlight2-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Spotlight2-510x680.jpeg 510w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Spotlight2-scaled.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px" /><br />

<h3><b>Lighting creates a visual impression</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what sets the spotlight apart from regular lamps. By focusing the light in a specific direction, the narrow beam angle and low illuminance spotlight lines draw attention to a particular place without negatively impacting the surrounding region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The living room is a great place to &#8220;show off&#8221; an area of your home that you&#8217;re particularly proud of, and the best way to do that is to direct some light there. The kitchen&#8217;s overhead lighting draws attention to the dishes by highlighting their most prominent hues, such as the fruit and cooking implements. Concurrently, the low ambient light inside will allow the spotlight to shine brighter. With the help of a single light fixture, even the simplest of walls or spaces may be transformed into eye-catching focal points.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effect of lighting on people&#8217;s emotions is significant. The proper lighting in the bedroom can help you get a good night&#8217;s sleep and feel revitalized when you wake up. The bedroom spotlight is essential to any &#8220;calming&#8221; or &#8220;calming&#8221;-themed bedroom.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Accent lighting for artistic purposes </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We see spotlights put to their most productive advantage at museums and galleries. The contrast between the bright light and the dark spaces draws attention to the artworks and highlights their colors, lines, and materials. The same effect can be used to fulfill the owner&#8217;s passion for art by transforming a hidden nook into a &#8220;mini-exhibition.&#8221; In restaurants, the spotlight has evolved from a decorative accessory to a functional lighting aid, bringing to fruition the vision of many inventive business owners who wanted to improve their patrons&#8217; dining experiences through improved taste and sight.</span></p>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using spotlights in restaurants</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spotlight is arguably the most crucial factor when deciding on supplemental lighting. A bright light marks each area and ushers in novel sensations. The secret to making a room stand out and capture everyone&#8217;s attention is to use spotlights thoughtfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the proper lighting is more than just improving the room&#8217;s aesthetics; it&#8217;s also about satisfying people&#8217;s basic human needs to live and feel something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When planning the lighting for one&#8217;s home or other personal space, one should consider Lumi Smart Home Vietnam&#8217;s high-end lighting solution, released on May 16th. Don&#8217;t pass up the chance to have and &#8220;create&#8221; with your own Lumi Lighting spotlight design.</span></p>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The connection between light and emotion</span></i></p>
<h3><strong>Color rendering index and the color of lights</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Color Rendering Index (CRI) measures how well a given light source portrays an object&#8217;s true color. For the CRI scale, sunlight is the reference standard for comparison with artificial light sources. It has led lights to use cutting-edge manufacturing technology to generate CRI&gt;90 (CRI closest to sunlight) with various color temperatures. Accent lighting, such as that provided by LED spotlights or bar lights, is widely employed in the interior design industry because of its ability to improve a room&#8217;s ambiance and atmosphere while also appealing to the eye.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-12461" src="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cphuong-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="1020" height="574" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cphuong-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cphuong-600x338.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cphuong-300x169.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cphuong-768x432.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cphuong-510x287.jpg 510w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cphuong.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The higher the color rendering index, the more transparent the true color of the object and the better for the human eye</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, many apartment owners care about light color or color temperature while making their lighting selections. The lighting needs of various rooms in a house will vary depending on factors such as wall paint color, main interior color, etc. Apartment owners can use white if they want to go for a contemporary look, warm white if they want to go for a traditional one, etc. In lighting design, the choice of any color temperature requires thought, skill, and experimentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each bulb family typically has a single &#8220;warm&#8221; or &#8220;cool&#8221; color temperature. Thanks to advanced technology, there are a few lamps that allow for precise control of the color temperature, ranging from 2700 to 6500. This enables the same light to serve many purposes in various settings, as desired by the lamp&#8217;s owner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Does the sophisticated lamp design suffice?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same way that not everyone can pull off a stunning ensemble, not everyone can &#8220;fit,&#8221; &#8220;measure, and manufacture shoes&#8221; for a gorgeous lamp that perfectly complements the room&#8217;s decor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Stunning illumination, indeed, but not adequate</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lighting design considers not only the previously mentioned technical requirements, such as color rendering index and color temperature but also the &#8220;historical scenario&#8221; use&#8221; of the apartment owner to make calculations and lighting selections. The lighting only works when there is a balance between the room&#8217;s technical and artistic elements. Therefore, the present and forthcoming trends in interior design are the models of pendant lights and wall lights that cater to the needs of smart lighting and customization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>… The era of smart lighting</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart lighting solutions are born in the age of Industry 4.0, when every connection is easier and more accessible to serve the owners&#8217; comfort. Smart lighting uses wireless connectivity to enable features such as remote control, timers, color adjustments through smartphone or voice, and compatibility with various home environments. Everything may be done with a feather&#8217;s touch, so relax and take pleasure in the comfort of your own home.</span></p>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the stroke of a button, you can adjust your lighting to suit any situation</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>…Lighting and personal impression</strong></h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to integrate with devices in the Smart Home ecosystem transforms Lumi&#8217;s new generation multi-room audio system into an indispensable piece for a new rhythm of life. Based on their creativity and imagination, music-loving homeowners can completely transform their living space into a musical world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are three multi-zone sound scenario ideas for your smart living space.</span></p>
<h3><b>1. The scenario of entertainment</b></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-13076" src="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Anh-tinh-nang-tieng-anh-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1020" height="680" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Anh-tinh-nang-tieng-anh-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Anh-tinh-nang-tieng-anh-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Anh-tinh-nang-tieng-anh-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Anh-tinh-nang-tieng-anh-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Anh-tinh-nang-tieng-anh-1-510x340.jpg 510w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Anh-tinh-nang-tieng-anh-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-room audio, which is easily integrated with various speaker systems and audio-visual devices, can transform your living room into a vibrant home entertainment space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you turn on the 16 million-color LED and multi-room audio system that connects to the TV, you&#8217;ve got the ideal room for home parties, movie nights, or karaoke. The multi-room audio experience differs from traditional speaker systems in that you only need one touch to turn on the lights, speakers, and air conditioners all at once and enjoy the authentic sound with high-quality Hi-res standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The &#8220;grouping devices&#8221; feature allows you to play a song in all rooms simultaneously, which helps spread the party atmosphere to other parts of the house or the entire outdoor garden. When you want to create a private music space, the &#8220;splitting devices&#8221; mode provides several options so that each room can play a song of their choice simultaneously, with no limit on the number of rooms and devices.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. The scenario of security</b></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-13078" src="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Anh-tinh-nang-tieng-anh-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1020" height="680" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Anh-tinh-nang-tieng-anh-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Anh-tinh-nang-tieng-anh-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Anh-tinh-nang-tieng-anh-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Anh-tinh-nang-tieng-anh-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Anh-tinh-nang-tieng-anh-2-510x340.jpg 510w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Anh-tinh-nang-tieng-anh-2.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security needs are always a top priority for many families. It is not enough to protect the house with a smart lock and to monitor it remotely with a camera system. With instant alerts, multi-room audio will strengthen the existing security barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alarms will be activated in pre-installed rooms when an unauthorized intrusion or young children enter dangerous areas such as kitchens and balconies are detected, assisting homeowners in quickly preventing such emergencies and ensuring the safety of all members.</span></p>
<h3><b>3. The scenario of timing</b></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-13060" src="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sp-tieng-anh-thuc-day-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="1020" height="679" srcset="https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sp-tieng-anh-thuc-day-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sp-tieng-anh-thuc-day-600x400.jpg 600w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sp-tieng-anh-thuc-day-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sp-tieng-anh-thuc-day-768x512.jpg 768w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sp-tieng-anh-thuc-day-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sp-tieng-anh-thuc-day-510x340.jpg 510w, https://lumi.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sp-tieng-anh-thuc-day.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider a home that greets the entire family with favorite music and soft lighting every time they return. Door sensors, automatic color temperature adjustment lights, and multi-room audio are part of this &#8220;home&#8221; context.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, your home will wake up the owner at 6 a.m. every morning with live music and put you to sleep at 11 p.m. with soothing music. The app&#8217;s music playback timer feature will assist you in making every moment of the day exciting and memorable.</span></p>
<h3><em><b>A new generation of multi-room audio from Lumi Vietnam</b></em></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lumi&#8217;s multi-room audio solution, introduced in 2016, meets most users&#8217; needs for playing music and creating convenient smarthome scenarios. Lumi was the first smarthome solution provider in Vietnam to research and developed a multi-zone audio system for the Smart Home ecosystem from that point forward. However, with the continuous flow of innovative technology and customers&#8217; increased needs, Lumi&#8217;s latest version of multi-room audio has been researched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can activate the smarthome in &#8220;one note&#8221; with personalized experiences, enhancing the audio experience with simple operation, diverse connectivity, and control. In addition, with the Lumi Music application dedicated to this system, users can use it independently as a high-quality audio solution in this version. Lumi&#8217;s new generation of multi-zone audio promises to be the market-leading version, with innovations aimed at modern customer satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep an eye out for updates on the next generation multi-room audio &#8211;</span><b><i> Your home, your way to play music </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the Lumi Smart Home Vietnam Fanpage and YouTube, and prepare to imagine your own scenario!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can select, play, or schedule the playback of their favorite song for the entire living space from their smartphone in just 3 seconds, thanks to the simple and intuitive interface. The operations are designed to be simple so that even the youngest or oldest members of the family can quickly become acquainted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can control the multi-room audio system for family members wherever you are. A smartphone button and multi-room audio for parents who frequently travel for business will care for their loved ones&#8217; sleep with melodious and smooth melodies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do users want to cook, do housework, and listen to music all at the same time? The voice control method will take the place of occupied hands in &#8220;commanding&#8221; the speaker system to play cheerful melodies and relieve fatigue. The new generation multi-room soundbar transforms into a musician who is always ready to listen to all owner requests by connecting with virtual assistants such as Google Assistant and Maika smart speaker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lumi&#8217;s multi-room audio module is always ready to connect to the market&#8217;s most popular speaker systems. It does not necessitate a powerful device platform operating system. Everything can become a synchronous and easy-to-control audio network, from smart TVs and portable speakers to living room sound systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lumi&#8217;s new generation of multi-room audio meets the strict demand for music quality with diverse music sources, from USB and cloud to popular online music sources like Spotify, Tidal, and Deezer. A multi-room audio system brings every musical taste and style to life in your home concert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new generation of multi-room audio, developed as a stand-alone solution, can be fully realized by connecting to a conventional speaker system. Homeowners can immediately own a modern multi-room audio system with only modular equipment and available home speakers without access via a smarthome app or link to a central controller.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be said that the ability to connect smoothly and operate independently &#8211; flexible integration and minimalist operation are the outstanding benefits of the Lumi Music multi-room audio generation. The new generation multi-room audio system will be an indispensable solution for modern life and a lifestyle that enjoys every moment to the fullest, in addition to the facilities serving lighting and security needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep an eye out for updates on the next generation multi-room audio &#8211; </span><b><i>Your home, your way to play music </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the Lumi Smart Home Vietnam Fanpage and YouTube, and prepare to imagine your own scenario!</span></p>
